>
> 随即她的魔法从塞拉斯的身体中穿过——但魔法却没有伤害他，而是从他的双手不受控制的涌出。

> 塞拉斯发现禁魔石其实并不压制魔法，而是**吸收**`<absorb>`魔法。  
> but he came to see that it did not suppress magic, but absorb it.  

#### 11
> 塞拉斯猜想如果魔法被存储在禁魔石**之内**`<within>`，那他是否能释放里面被吸收的魔法……？。  
> And if the power was held within the petricite, Sylas wondered, could he release it…?.  

#### 12
> 他所欠缺的只是一个魔法源头。  
> All he needed was a source of magic.  
>
> 一个像拉克丝一样的魔法源头。

>
> 就像他想象的一样，镣铐吸收了拉克丝的魔法，而塞拉斯随时都可以将这些魔法释放。  
> As he had predicted, her power surged into the petricite shackles, ready for him to unleash—  
>
> 他使用偷来的魔法~~杀害了场上所有人~~，除了饱受惊吓的拉克丝。  
> and with that stolen magic, **Sylas blasted his way free**, sparing only the terrified young Crownguard.  

#### 15
> 塞拉斯不是以逃犯的身份离开搜魔人监狱，而是成为了法师反抗的代表。  
> He left the mageseeker compound not as an outcast, but as a new, defiant symbol of the broken and persecuted in Demacia.  
>
> 他在德玛西亚隐秘的游荡并召集了被放逐的法师们。
