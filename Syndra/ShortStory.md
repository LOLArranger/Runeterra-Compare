> 逐渐昏暗下来的森林美不胜收，不过女孩无心观赏，跺着脚走在蜿蜒曲折的小路上。  
> The darkening forest was full of beauty, but the girl saw none of it as she stomped along the winding path.
>
> 发光的翅萤在暮色中翩翩起舞，身后留下夜光残影，但女孩重重地将它们从面前拍走，毫不在意这转瞬即逝的优雅。  
> Glowing flitterwings danced through the twilight, leaving trails of luminescence in their wake, but she swatted them out of her face, oblivious to their fleeting grace.
>
> 她双眼垂向地面，踢开一块石头，任其在盘错的树根间跳跃，毫不理会茂密华盖间透过的夕阳。  
> Eyes downcast, she kicked a rock, sending it skidding over the roots twisting across her path, blind to the glorious sunset glimpsed through the canopy. 
>
> 紫夜貂的花瓣缓缓张开，向温润的暮色吐出微光的花粉，但匆匆路过的她却顺手将花茎扭断。  
> The delicate violet petals of a blooming night-sable unfurled to release its glowing pollen into the warm evening, but she reached out and twisted the flower off its stem as she passed.

> 她的脸颊由于羞愧和愤怒而烧得通红。  
> Her face burned with shame and anger.
>
> 母亲的责备依然萦绕在耳边，哥哥和其他孩子的嘲笑始终挥之不去。  
> The scolding from her mother still lingered, and the laughter of her brother and the others seemed to follow her.

> 她停下脚步，回头看向小路上残破的花瓣，皱起了眉头。  
> She paused, looking back at the broken petals on the path, and frowned.
>
> 这一切都有些异样……似乎她早已经历过这一切。她摇了摇头，继续向前走，深入茂密的森林。  
> There was something strangely familiar about all of this… almost like she’d lived it before. She shook her head and continued on, deeper into the forest.

> 她终于来到了神圣的**灵柳**`ghost-willow`前。  
> Finally, she stood before the sacred ghost-willow.
>
> 它慵懒的枝条犹如在水中漂荡，摩挲碰撞着发出风铃般的低语。  
> Its limbs moved languidly, as if underwater, accompanied by the faint, musical whisper of bone chimes.

> 虽然她体内的怒火依然炽烈，  
> While the anger still coursed through her, hot and fierce, she closed her eyes and forced her fists to unclench.
>
> 但她闭上眼，握紧拳，缓缓地吸一口气，就像长老教她的那样，努力压住狂怒。  
> She breathed in, slowly, just as the old master had taught her, trying to push back her rage.

> 她被什么东西打中了，硬邦邦的东西，不偏不倚地打在她后脑，她扑向前跪倒在地。  
> Something hit her, hard, in the back of the head, and she fell to her knees.
>
> 她用一只手碰了碰被打的地方，手指沾满了血。  
> She touched a hand where she’d been struck, and her fingers came away bloody.
>
> 然后她听到了嘲笑声，于是她的狂怒涌了上来。
> Then she heard the laughter, and her fury surged to the fore.

> 她站了起来，面向她的哥哥和其他孩子，她的双眼射出炫目的黑暗，  
> She stood and turned towards her brother and the others, her eyes dark and glaring.
>
> 她的呼吸粗重而又急促，她的双手又在身侧握成拳头，刚刚一切让自己冷静下来的努力瞬间就被闪烁的愤怒盖过。  
> Her breathing was heavy and short, and her hands clenched into fists at her side once more, all the effort to calm herself a moment before lost in a flash of anger.
>
> 怒火在她体内熊熊燃烧，如同一种凶恶的疾病，不断进犯不断膨胀，她周围的空气似乎泛起微光，而她身后的那棵灵柳则开始褪色枯萎。  
> As it built within her, compounding and growing like a malignant sickness, the air around her seemed to shimmer, and the ghost-willow began to fade and wither behind her.
>
> 红色的树液像泪水一样潸然落下，柳叶卷曲着变成黑色。  
> It wept red sap, its leaves curling and blackening.

> 早在无人记得的远古，这片土地的魔法就开始滋养这棵灵柳，它又以同样的方式滋养了这片土地和上面的人民，  
> Since time immemorial the magic of this land had nourished the ghost-willow, just as it in turn nourished the land and its people,
>
> 然而现在它即将死去，柔软的柳条变得像枯骨一样干瘪清脆，土壤中的树根痛苦地卷曲。  
> but now it was dying, its supple limbs turning bone-dry and brittle, its roots curling in pain.
>
> 枝头的风铃敲响亡语的丧钟，但女孩没有听见灵柳，她已迷失于鼎沸的狂怒之中。  
> Its chimes tolled a mournful death-rattle, but the girl didn’t hear it, lost in the moment of her seething fury.

> 随着那颗古老原始的灵树消逝，女孩离开了地面，漂浮于空中。  
> As the ancient, primordial tree perished, the little girl began to lift off the ground, rising into the air. 
>
> 三颗吞没光亮的至暗球体开始在女孩周围环绕。  
> Three light-swallowing spheres of absolute darkness began to orbit around the child.

> 折磨她的人现在全都笑不出来了……  
> Her tormentors were not laughing now...
#### 02
> **卡兰**`Kalan`站在**斐洛尔**`Fae’lor`的城防垛口上，视线越过狭海投向**初生之土**`the First Lands`的内陆——如今被人类称为**艾欧尼亚**`Ionia`的那片土地。  
> Kalan stood upon the battements of Fae’lor, looking across the narrow sea towards the mainland of the First Lands—what humans now called Ionia.

> 今晚没有月亮，但一切都如同白昼一般被他尽收眼底，他猫科动物的瞳孔已开到最大。  
> It was a dark, moonless night, but he saw as clearly as if it were daylight, the pupils of his feline eyes fully dilated.
>
> 有的时候，这双眼睛会被火炬照亮，并反射出炯炯的神光——这是一双暗夜掠食者的眼睛。  
> Occasionally, they caught the gleam of torch-light and reflected it back brightly; the mirrored eyes of a night predator.

> 卡兰是**瓦斯塔亚**`vastaya`，血脉可追溯至远古。  
> Kalan was vastaya, of the ancient bloodline.
>
> 他落日般耀眼的毛发编成一根根脏辫垂在后背，只不过如今他的毛发中夹杂了一缕缕灰丝。  
> His fur was russet-red and hung down his back in long, intricate, knotted braids that now had more than a few streaks of grey in them.
>
> 他骄傲的面庞如同大型猫科捕食者，一生的戎马在他脸上写满纵横的伤疤。  
> His proud face was akin to that of a great hunting cat, and criss-crossed with scars from a lifetime of battle.
>
> 他左侧的面庞没有毛发，怒张的红色肌理是他作为年轻战士时严重灼伤的证明。  
> The left side of that face was furless, and angry red welts bore evidence of the horrible burns he’d suffered as a young warrior.
>
> 他的太阳穴处生出一对弯曲的犄角，每一根都印刻着螺旋的符文图案，他的三条尾巴在身后扫来扫去，每一条都覆盖着一节节板甲。  
> Curling horns sprouted from his temples, each engraved with spiralling ***runic patterns***, and his three tails swished behind him, each covered in segmented plate.
>
> 他穿着**诺克萨斯的**`Noxian`黑铁铠甲，这身来自他第二祖国的装束总是让他愁容满面。  
> The armor he wore was Noxian dark iron, and he wore the trappings of his adopted empire with a scowl.

> 有人叫他叛徒，说他既背叛了艾欧尼亚，也背叛了瓦斯塔亚的传承，但他不在乎。
> Some called him a traitor, both to Ionia and his vastayan heritage, but he didn’t care.
>
> 他们怎么想无关紧要。
> What they thought didn’t matter.

> 斐洛尔要塞坐落于艾欧尼亚最西边的岛上。  
> The fortress of Fae’lor was built upon the ***westernmost*** island of Ionia.
>
> 易守难攻，在此伫立了上百年，抵挡过无数敌人的进攻，  
> Highly defensible, this place had remained for centuries, standing against countless foes,
>
> 但最后还是在诺克萨斯入侵期间溃于一次漫长的围城。  
> before being finally overrun after a long siege during the Noxian invasion.

> 那个时候卡兰还没有加入**诺克萨斯**`Noxus`。在命运的分叉口，**普雷西典**`Placidium`之战，他向**斯维因**`Swain`投诚。  
> That was before Kalan had joined Noxus, before the fateful Battle of the Placidium when he’d pledged himself to Swain.  
>
> 后来又向帝国索要了斐洛尔统治者的位置作为奖赏。  
> Before he’d requested this post as governor of Fae’lor as reward for his service.

> 诺克萨斯人在他背后嘲笑他，他很清楚。  
> The Noxians laughed at him behind his back, he knew.
>
> 他原本可以换来更丰厚的赏赐——但他还是选择了斐洛尔，这个帝国边缘被遗忘的角落。  
> He could have had a far more prestigious posting—but he had chosen Fae’lor, at the forgotten edge of the empire.

>他们不明白。但他觉得无所谓。他需要留在这。  
>They didn’t understand, and that mattered nothing to him. He needed to be here.

> 当然，诺克萨斯并没有赢得那场战争……但艾欧尼亚也不是胜利者。  
> Noxus had not won the war, of course… but nor had Ionia.
>
> 总之，那场战斗过了几个春秋，斐洛尔依然被侵略者掌控。  
> Nevertheless, many seasons after the end of the campaign, Fae’lor remained under the invaders’ control.

> 现有三十三条战舰停靠在此，还有不到这个数目一半的商贸船只。  
> Thirty-three warships were currently docked here, as well as perhaps half that number of trader vessels and merchant ships.
>
> 在他麾下共有一千多名诺克萨斯战士，由帝国各个偏远角落的战团老兵混编而成。  
> Over a thousand warriors of Noxus—a mix of veteran warbands hailing from the far corners of the empire—were stationed here under his leadership.

> 一队巡逻兵沿着垛口踏步经过。  
> A guard patrol stomped along the battlements.
>
> 他们向卡兰敬礼，用拳头重重打在自己的胸甲上，卡兰点头回礼。  
> They saluted, fists crashing against breastplates, and he gave a nod in return.
>
> 他并没漏掉哨兵们眼神中的黑暗  
> He didn’t fail to miss the dark looks they gave him as they marched by.
>
> 他们对他的憎恨并不亚于艾欧尼亚人，但他们对他存有畏惧和尊敬，而这就已经足够了。  
> They hated him almost as much as his own people did, but they feared and respected him, and that was enough.

> 他回过头再度看向狭海对面，驻足于重重往事。  
> He turned to look back across the sea once more, brooding on the past.
>
> 他为什么在这里？  
> Why was he here?
>
> 这个问题每天都会从他属下的眼神中发出，也会在最黑暗的夜里爬上他的心头，  
> It was a question he saw in the eyes of his subordinates every day, and one that crept up on him the darkest of nights,
>
> 在那些夜里，森林和狩猎在呼唤他。然而，答案很简单。  
> those nights when the forest, and the hunt, called to him. The answer was simple, however.

> 他在这里是为了能够一直守望她。  
> He remained here to keep watch over her.
#### 03
一对黑衣人从海里钻了出来，一男一女，如死亡般无影无声。他们像蜘蛛一样敏捷地爬上了猩红女猎手号战舰近乎垂直的侧舷，沿着舷缘悄声潜行。他们的刀刃闪着寒光，战舰的守夜哨兵被悄无声息地放倒，接二连三，没有发出任何警报。
A pair of dark-clad figures—one female, one male—emerged from the sea, unseen, and as silent as death. Swiftly, moving like spiders, they scaled the near-vertical hull of the warship Crimson Huntress, and slunk over its gunwale. Their blades glinted, and the ship’s night wardens were silently dispatched, one after another, without any alarm being sounded.

片刻，全部五个诺克萨斯哨兵全都毙命，他们的鲜血开始漏到甲板上。
Within moments, all five Noxians were dead, their lifeblood leaking out onto the deck.

“干的利索，老弟，”其中一人开口说道，俯身藏在上层甲板的阴影中。在她脸上，只能看到一对眼睛和周围缠绕的靛蓝刺青。
“Neatly done, little brother,” said one of the pair, now crouched in the shadow of the upper deck. Of her face, only her eyes and the swirling indigo tattoos that surrounded them were visible.

“这要感谢我略有才能的老师，”另一个人答道。他也穿着一袭黑衣，伏在黑影中，只不过在他姐姐脸上刺青的位置，他的皮肤是厚实的瘢痕刻印。
“I had a passably decent teacher,” replied the other. He too was fully clad in black and crouched in shadow, though in place of his sister’s swirling tattoos, his skin was a solid block of etched flesh.

“略有才能，奥金？”她提起一瞥眉毛说道。
“Passably decent, Okin?” she replied, one eyebrow rising.

“不能让你太骄傲，希里克，”她的弟弟回答。
“No need to feed your ego, Sirik,” her brother replied.

“不闹了，”希里克说。她打开了后腰上系着的皮包，缓缓取出了一方用蜡封和皮革紧紧裹住的东西。她小心翼翼地将外包解开，亮出一块拳头大小的黑水晶。
“Enough fooling around,” said Sirik. She opened a black leather pouch at her hip and delicately removed an object, tightly bound in waxed leather. She unwrapped it, gingerly, revealing a fist-sized, black crystal.

“没湿吧？”奥金悄悄问道。
“Is it dry?” whispered Okin.

作为回答，希里克轻轻摇晃了一下水晶。一道橙色的火光从水晶中心一闪而过，如同被煽动的余烬
In answer, Sirik gently shook the crystal. A hint of an orange glow lit it from within for a brief moment, like a fanned ember.

“看样是的。我会给他找个好地方，”她一边说，一边点头示意了附近的一扇门，门后通往下层甲板。“你发信号通知其他人。”
“It would seem so. I’ll find a suitable place for it,” she said, nodding to the nearby door leading below deck. “You signal the others.”

奥金点了点头。希里克飘到下层甲板，她的弟弟悄悄回到船舷边缘。他将上半身探到外侧做了个手势。又有七个黑衣人从黑暗的水里出现，静悄悄地爬到甲板上，拥入黑影中。
Okin nodded. Sirik ghosted below deck, and her brother moved silently back to the gunwale. He leaned over the edge and beckoned. Seven other black-clad figures rose from the dark water below, climbing soundlessly up onto the deck of the ship, hugging the shadows.

他们是无告者，是最后一批留下来的战士。在诺克萨斯扳走斐洛尔以前，他们都是要塞的哨兵。那场失败的耻辱依然在他们心中常燃不灭，将诺克萨斯人逐出祖先土地的愿望亦不曾熄止。
They were the dispossessed—the last remaining warriors who had served here at the fortress of Fae’lor, before the Noxians had wrested it from them. The shame of that defeat still burned in their hearts, as did the desire to see every Noxian pushed from their ancestral homelands.

所有人都在甲板上到齐后，他们稍作等待，几分钟后希里克出现了。
Once all were on deck, they waited a moment for Sirik, who emerged after a few minutes.

“完事，”她说。
“It is done,” she said.

九名艾欧尼亚无告者流向战舰的一侧，紧跟着带头的姐弟俩。他们的动作行云流水，沿着石台码头向斐洛尔要塞方向轻巧地跑去。
The nine dispossessed Ionians flowed over the ship’s side, following the leading pair. They moved as fluidly as water, and ran lightly along the stone dock towards the fortress of Fae’lor.

他们从一处阴影冲进另一处阴影，如同九个幽灵，最后一起停在第一堵高墙下。他们拥入黑暗，纹丝不动地等一支巡逻队走过，几名诺克萨斯战士用他们粗糙的语言谈天说笑，被尺开外的艾欧尼亚人用夜视眼看的一清二楚。
From shadow to shadow they darted, like specters, until they reached the first wall. Hugging the darkness, they remained utterly motionless as a patrol marched by, the Noxian warriors speaking in their guttural language and laughing, utterly oblivious to the nigh-invisible Ionians crouched mere feet away.
巡逻队刚转过拐角，几名潜入者就再次行动，爬上光秃秃的墙壁，双手利落地交替攀援。他们看上去毫不费力，如同攀爬云梯，只不过事实上并没有任何扶手。
As soon as the patrol turned a corner, the infiltrators snapped into motion once more, climbing the sheer surface of the wall, moving swiftly, hand-over-hand. They made it look easy, like climbing a ladder, though in truth there were virtually no handholds.

希里克最先爬到垛口处。她探头瞥了一眼，然后迅速缩回身子，完全静止不动，一只手挂在垛口处。她下面的人也全都静止不动，看到她迅速做出一系列手势，便迅速爬上与她同高的位置。她握起一只拳，然后攀上墙头，她的弟弟奥金紧随其后。诺克萨斯人浑然不知这对艾欧尼亚人如幽灵般尾随其后，在垛口顶端轻轻腾挪。
Sirik reached the crenellations first. She peered over, then ducked swiftly back and went perfectly still, clinging one-handed to the battlements. The others below her froze, then hurriedly climbed to join her as she made a series of swift hand-movements. She made a fist, before climbing atop the wall, joined by her brother, Okin. None of the Noxians saw the pair of Ionians ghosting along behind them, hopping lightly across the top of the battlements in their wake.

随后，希里克和奥金跳入敌人中间，四名卫兵连刀都没拔出来就都被杀掉了。
Then Sirik and Okin leapt among the enemy, and the four guards were killed before a single one drew a blade.

最后一个卫兵被杀的时候紧紧捂住自己的脖子，捂不住潺潺流出的鲜血，继而摇晃着跌向城墙边缘，希里克抓住了他，就像捧着自己的情侣一样拥他入怀，然后将他缓缓放到地上；如果他倒了下去，撞击的声音无疑会引起警戒。
The last of them clutched his throat, blood welling beneath his hand, and teetered on the edge of the wall. Sirik grabbed him, like a lover enfolding her paramour in her arms, and lowered him gently to the ground; if he’d fallen, the sound would undoubtedly have raised the alarm.

附近其他两名守卫也被迅速放倒，无声且无情，随后其他艾欧尼亚人都翻上城墙。稍作停顿后，九个身影如同一个人般继续行动，冲过一片开阔的庭院，开始攀爬要塞内层的高墙。
Two other guards nearby were swiftly dispatched, silently and without mercy, as the other Ionians came over the wall. Then, as one, the nine moved on, darting across an open courtyard and scaling a second, inner wall.

每个人都对自己的目标了然于心，每个人都对要塞的地形了如指掌，因为这里是他们自己人构筑的工事。诺克萨斯人只不过是暂时的占领者。
Each of them knew their target, and each knew the precise layout of the fortress, for it had been their own people who had constructed it. The Noxians were merely its current occupants.

他们攀上内墙，翻过垛口，简直有如神助一般，恰好错开了墙上的两队哨兵。斐洛尔要塞背靠的高崖此刻为他们提供了阴影，让他们融入黑夜中。
They scrambled up the inner wall, and flowed over the parapet, their timing almost preternatural as they avoided two pairs of a sentries atop the wall. They ducked into the shadow of the jutting stone bluff Fae’lor abutted, and became as one with the darkness.

就在这时他们听到一声大吼，从码头的方向回荡。
That was when a shout sounded, echoing up from the docks.

奥金把咒骂声藏在呼吸里。“他们知道了，”他嘶嘶地说道。
Okin cursed under his breath. “They know we’re here,” he hissed.

“我原本希望能在第一具尸体被发现的时候再深入一些的，”希里克说，“但这无关紧要。我们继续按计划行事。”
“I had hoped to be further in before they discovered the first body,” said Sirik, “but this changes nothing. We continue as planned.”

第一声吼叫后跟来了了更多声吼叫，随后钟声响起，回荡在整座要塞中。
The first shout was echoed by others, and a bell began to toll, sounding out across the fortress.

“时机已到，声东击西，”希里克说道。她闭上双眼，让心中的随想静默下来。她睁开心灵之眼，看到了她藏在诺克萨斯战舰甲板下的那枚黑水晶，然后她贴进水晶，将其煽动活跃。
“Time for our distraction,” said Sirik. She closed her eyes and silenced her inner thoughts. In her mind’s eye, she saw the black crystal she’d secreted below the deck of the Noxian warship, and she reached out to it, fanning it to life.

她并不是魔术师，也不是灵魂魔法师，但就像她大多数同胞一样，她能感受到这片土地上的魔法，并能以极其微不足道的方式对其进行操控。她的能力只是很普通的天赋，就像她村里的农民也能往庄稼里扭进小小的魔法。在外人眼里看着很惊奇，但在她的同胞中，这种简单的天赋没什么了不起，也不会让人意外。这就像吹口哨，或者纵卷舌头——有人天生就能，有人一辈子也不能。
She was no conjurer or soul-mage, but like many of her people, she could feel and subtly manipulate the magic of the land in minor, fairly insignificant ways. Hers was just a small, common gift, akin to that of the farmers of her village who spun a little magic into their crops. To outsiders this was shocking, but among her people, such simple gifts were not at all unusual, nor regarded as anything to be held in awe. It was like being able to whistle, or curl your tongue—some people could do it, others couldn’t.

希里克调整呼吸的深度，强化了无声的祈求，鼓动那颗火焰石发挥自己原本的特性。
Sirik deepened her breathing, and intensified her silent entreaties, encouraging the fyrestone to do what was it its nature to do.

她的天赋能力很小，但它引发的水晶活化的效果绝不小。当然，火焰石本身的不稳定性是主要，她的天生能力是次要，但无论怎么说，制造出的结果很震撼。
Her gift might have been minor, but the effect of it as she nudged the crystal to life was not. That had more to do with the volatile nature of the fyrestone crystal than any innate power of her own, of course, but nevertheless, the result was impressive.

在下方的港湾里，那艘诺克萨斯的猩红女猎手号战舰爆炸了，一团火球推着热浪照亮了黑夜。所有被斐洛尔的警戒钟声唤起的士兵全都停下了脚步，呆呆地望向那片突然出现的炼狱火海。
In the harbor below, the Noxian warship Crimson Huntress exploded, lighting up the night in a billowing fireball. Soldiers who were responding to Fae’lor’s warning bells stopped in their tracks, turning towards sudden inferno.

希里克睁开双眼。“走。”她说。
Sirik opened her eyes. “Let’s go,” she said.
#### 04
卡兰悄悄来到石台码头前，两侧跟着卫兵，他的三条尾巴充满威胁地扫来扫去。
Kalan stalked onto the stone dock, flanked by guards, his three tails swishing dangerously.

“艾欧尼亚人的暗中破坏，我猜是的，大人，”一个面色紧张的军官说道，他需要小步慢跑才能跟得上卡兰的步伐。“黑火药的爆炸，估计是。”
“The work of Ionian saboteurs, I would guess, my lord,” said a nervous-looking officer, trotting to keep up with Kalan’s long strides. “A black powder detonation, most likely.”

卡兰停下脚步，眉头紧锁地观察码头上的损害。
Kalan halted and frowned deeply as he surveyed the mayhem on the docks.

猩红女猎手号已经彻底不再，只剩下船底。还有木料尚存的地方都在着火。旁边三艘船也都被引燃，虽然船员们在奋力救火，但卡兰瞥一眼就知道其中至少已经有一艘船救不回来了，他气恼地吼了一声，露出了一排尖牙。
The Crimson Huntress was no more, reduced to the waterline. What timbers remained still burned. Three other nearby vessels were ablaze, and while crews worked to put out the flames, Kalan could see at a glance that at least one of them was a lost cause, and he snarled in frustration, exposing his teeth.

“我们已经拿下了码头，目前正在搜查所有其他船只，”那名紧张的军官说道。“如果还有更多爆炸物，我们一定会搜出来。”
“We’ve secured the docks, and a thorough search of all other ships is currently underway,” said the nervous officer. “If there are more explosives, they will be found.”

卡兰没有理会他，怀疑地眯起眼睛。他单膝跪下，在地上抓了几下，然后拿到鼻子前闻了闻。
Kalan ignored him, eyes narrowed. He dropped to one knee and scratched at the ground, then lifted his hand to his nose, sniffing.

“如果他们还在这里，大人，一定躲不了太久，”那位军官说道，显然他对长官的沉默感到不舒服。“不过，我猜他们已经逃出很远了。”
“If they are still here, lord, we’ll find them,” said the officer, clearly uncomfortable with his superior’s silence. “I’d guess they are long gone, though.”

卡兰站起来，沿着码头看向海洋的另一侧，看向高耸的城墙。
Kalan stood, and looked back along the dock, away from the sea, towards the towering walls.

“懦弱之举，”那名军官评价道。“他们知道攻城战打不赢我们，所以他们只能用其他方式伤害我们。但我们不会善罢甘休！我们是诺克萨斯！我们——”
“A cowardly act,” the officer remarked. “They know they can’t take us in a siege, so they try to hurt us in other ways. But we will not be deterred! We are Noxus! We—”

“安静，”卡兰吼道。他终于正眼看了那名军官，他黄色的双眼一下不眨。那个人在他的凝视下面色煞白，似乎身体也变矮小了，就如同一只蟾蜍缩回自己的土洞。“炸的是火焰石，不是黑火药。而且他们就在这里。这不是懦弱之举。”
“Be silent,” growled Kalan. He was looking at the officer for the first time now, his yellow eyes unblinking. The man paled under his gaze, and seemed to shrink a little, like a toad retreating into its hole. “It was fyrestone, not blackpowder. And they are still here. This was not an act of cowards.”

那名军官大气都不敢喘。“不是啊？”他鼓足勇气挤出几个字，音量还不如老鼠叫。
The officer gaped silently, like a landed fish. “No?” he managed, finally, his voice little more than a squeak.

“不是。”卡兰扭过头，向着斐洛尔要塞大步返回。“这是声东击西。”
“No.” Kalan swung away from him, and strode back towards the fortress of Fae’lor. “This is a distraction.”

卡兰火冒三丈。他待会再和这个蠢货算账。现在，他需要关注一件更重要的事。
Kalan seethed. He would deal with that fool later. Right now, he had something far more important to focus on.

“他们的目标是幻梦池。”他怒吼道。
“They are going for the Dreaming Pool,” he snarled.
#### 05
希里克用手捂住这名诺克萨斯人的嘴，直到他停止挣扎，然后将他死沉沉的尸体放到地上。她用他的外套把自己血淋淋的匕首擦干，用余光看到她的弟弟和其他人处理了其他诺克萨斯人，清空了这座塔楼的底层。
Sirik kept her hand clamped across the Noxian’s mouth until his struggles ceased, then dropped his lifeless body to the ground. She wiped her bloody dagger clean on his tunic and glanced around to see her brother and the others deal with the remaining Noxians within the lower level of the tower.

他们现在已经很接近了。前方庭院的另一侧，一座山崖伸向夜空，希里克的目光瞄向顶峰。一座突兀的建筑挡在星空中，那里便是他们的目标。
They were close, now. A rocky bluff reached up to the night sky in the courtyard beyond their position, and Sirik’s eyes were drawn to its peak. A jutting structure, blotting out the stars, marked their target.

警钟依然在轰鸣，传遍整个斐洛尔。
Tolling bells were sounding the alarm, echoing all across Fae’lor.

希里克带头走到庭院中间，离开高塔，开始向悬崖边凿刻的石阶奔跑。她现在已经不在乎是否会被看到了。诡计的时机已经过去。此刻速度才是最好的朋友。
Sirik led the way out into the courtyard, breaking from the tower and sprinting towards the stone steps carved into the bluff. She didn’t care who saw them now. The time for subterfuge was passed. Now speed was the best ally.

他们头顶上传来喊叫声，箭矢追着空地上冲刺的艾欧尼亚人。无一命中，全都打在他们脚边的鹅卵石地面上。几名卫兵从附近的门后冲出，前来阻截他们。希里克和同伴们丝毫没有停下脚步，他们抽出武器，弯刀、忍镰、毒镖和铁扇。一下心跳的功夫，他们已经突入诺克萨斯人中间，或滑铲、或空翻，同时给与夺命重击，像跳舞一般突入敌阵。
Shouts erupted from above, and arrows chased the Ionians as they darted across the open space. None hit home, skidding off the cobbled stone at their feet. A handful of guards emerged from a nearby gate, rushing to intercept them. Sirik and her companions didn’t even slow as they drew weapons; curved swords, sickles, poisoned darts and bladed fans. In a heartbeat they were among the Noxians, sliding under and somersaulting over heavy blows, dancing through them, blades wreaking a bloody toll.

艾欧尼亚人遭受了首个牺牲，一个人被长戟砍中了脖子。希里克将刹那的哀伤压了回去，继续向前推进，和弟弟并肩冲破了敌阵，留下数个血泊中的诺克萨斯人。
The first of the Ionians fell, then, hacked down by a heavy halberd blow to the neck. Sirik pushed her instant pang of grief within, and pushed on, breaking through the enemy with her brother at her side, leaving a handful of them bleeding in their wake.

他们到达了坑洼不平的石阶——这些石阶经历的风雨沧桑远多于要塞本身。他们向上冲刺，一步三个台阶。石阶两侧的许愿灯笼全都是黑的。
They reached the carved, uneven steps—far older than the fortress itself—and began sprinting up, toward the peak, taking the stairs three at a time. Votive lanterns carved into the rock on either side of the stairs remained dark.

在诺克萨斯占领这个圣所之前，这些灯笼始终长明，昼夜不熄。
Before Noxus had taken this holy place, those would never have remained unlit, day or night.

又一名艾欧尼亚人倒下了，两根箭矢重重地插入他的胸膛。他没发出任何声音，从傍崖的石阶路上翻身落下，摔在下面的庭院里。其余的艾欧尼亚人继续沿着螺旋攀升的石阶向顶端冲刺。又有更多箭矢打在他们身边的崖壁上，所幸的是她没有同伴再被击中。
Another Ionian fell, two arrows thudding into his chest. Without a sound, he toppled from the path, falling to the courtyard below. On and on, the remaining Ionians ran, climbing the spiralling path encircling the stone bluff towards its peak. More arrows clattered against the rock wall beside them, but thankfully no more of her companions were struck.

他们急速绕上弧形的阶梯。金属的寒光一闪而过，迹象虽然微小，但依然引起了希里克的警觉，让她本能地飞身翻滚。一根重矛，被巨大的力量掷出，与她相隔几寸距离擦身而过，击中了她身后的同伴。长矛穿胸而过，他整个身体都被带飞到半空，跌下悬崖。
They rounded the curve at speed. A flash of metal in the night was all the warning Sirik had, and she threw herself instinctively into a roll. A heavy spear, thrown with great force, sliced scant inches over her to strike one of her companions behind. It took him in the chest and lifted him off his feet, hurling him off the bluff.

两名守卫站在悬崖顶端的神庙入口处严阵以待。两个人都肌肉健硕，身穿黑色重甲，一手擎着巨盾，另一手紧握锯齿切肉斧。
Two guards stood before the entrance to the shrine at the top of the bluff. Both were immense slabs of muscle and heavy black armor, with huge shields and heavy, jagged cleavers clutched in their brutish fists.

剩余的留个艾欧尼亚人整齐划一地出击，冲刺、飞扑、空翻着迎击两个魁梧的诺克萨斯人，刀光剑影、杀气腾腾。
The six remaining Ionians attacked as one, sprinting, leaping and somersaulting towards the towering Noxians, blades glinting.

希里克利用运动中的速度，跑上了悬崖的立面，飞奔两步以后向前跨越，双手中的短刀寻向卫兵的脖颈，与此同时她的弟弟则攻向下盘。奥金翻滚着避开诺克萨斯人的横扫，反手划破对手的一条腿，让对手踉跄失衡。希里克像一根长枪一样刺破空气，双刀当先，在那个诺克萨斯人厚重的脖颈上切开两道深沟。
Moving at speed, Sirik ran up onto the side of the bluff, taking two steps across its vertical surface before leaping off, her short blades seeking the neck of the first guard, even as her brother attacked low. Okin rolled under a heavy swinging blow and came up behind the Noxian, slashing a backhanded blow across his foe’s leg, making him stumble. Sirik speared through the air, leading with her blades, carving a pair of deep furrows through the solid meat of the Noxian’s neck.

但他并没有立刻倒下。希里克轻巧落地，身体蹲伏，一只手扶地保持平衡，那名战士咆哮着用塔盾的正面将一名艾欧尼亚无告者撞翻在地。还没等希里克再次出手，那名野蛮的战士就用盾缘切向她伙伴的脖子，一击毙命。
Still, he did not fall, and as Sirik landed lightly in a low crouch, one hand touching the ground for balance, the injured warrior roared and smashed one of the dispossessed Ionians to the ground with the flat of his tower shield. Before Sirik could intervene, the brute slammed the ridge of that shield down onto her fallen comrade’s neck, killing him instantly.

另一名诺克萨斯战士也同样棘手，她像一头受伤的公牛一样怒吼着，疯狂地甩打，但实际上她的致命伤口一直在流血，换成普通人应该早就死了。
The other Noxian was proving equally difficult to put down, bellowing like a wounded bull and flailing about wildly, even as she bled from wounds that would have killed most, lesser individuals.

奥金在她厚重胸甲的侧面找到破绽，砍断了诺克萨斯人的肋骨，然后立刻跳到一旁，躲开了反击。希里克看准时机冲上前，又补了一刀，而当敌人向她的方向砍来，另一个同伴再度见缝插针，从背后命中了那个诺克萨斯人。他们就像无情的群狼围攻大型猎物，最后那名诺克萨斯女战士终于跪倒在地，鲜血流了一地。她的上半身继续保持直立了一段时间，吐出几句咒骂，然后趴到了地上一动不动。
Okin hacked into the Noxian’s ribs, just to the side of her heavy breastplate, and danced aside as his enemy turned on him. Sirik darted in then, landing another strike, and as her enemy swung in her direction, another of her companions did likewise, hitting the Noxian from behind. They fought like a pack mercilessly taking down large prey, and at last the other Noxian dropped to her knees, lifeblood leaking out onto the stones. She stayed upright for a moment more, spitting curses, then fell facedown and was still.

她的同伴悲愤交加地咆哮一声，手里的切肉斧一记野蛮的挥砍，击倒了一名无告者。然后他跑向倒在地上的伙伴，跪在地上用巨大的臂膀将她拥入怀抱。他已斗志全无，对着夜空发出一声惨烈、痛苦的哀嚎。
Her companion roared in grief and anger, and hacked one of the dispossessed down with a brutal sweep of his cleaver. Then he ran to his fallen comrade, dropping to his knees and cradling her in his huge arms. All the fight had gone out of him, and he let out a terrible, anguished wail to the night sky.

奥金和其他人围上来准备进行最后一击，但希里克摇了摇头。“别管他了，”他说道。“正事要紧。”
Okin and the others encircled him to land the killing blow, but Sirik shook her head. “Leave him be,” she said. “Come. Let’s finish this.”

那个诺克萨斯人听不懂她说的话，但却听出了她的意图。他抬起满是忧伤的双眼，重新站了起来，捡起武器。然后他发出最后的战吼，向希里克冲了过来。他没走几步就被砍倒在地——可能这正是他所期望的。然后他倒在另一名诺克萨斯人身边，用最后的力气把手伸向她，彻底咽了气。
The Noxian didn’t understand her words, but recognized their intent. He looked up with grief-filled eyes, and regained his feet, picking up his blade. Then, with a cry, he launched himself at Sirik. He was cut down before he went more than a few steps—as he’d likely expected—and he dropped beside the other Noxian. With his last breath, he reached out to her, then went limp.

虽然身为敌人，但他的死让希里克感到悲哀。他们两个是亲人？情侣？还是朋友？她深吸一口气，将这些情感推到一边，继续专心完成这次的任务。
His death saddened Sirik, for all that he was an enemy. Were they kin, these two? Lovers? Friends? With a deep breath, she pushed those feelings aside, so as to focus on the task at hand.

她静静地点了点头，带领剩下的四个艾欧尼亚无告者进入了这座神庙，他的族人称之为达尔耶·阿希拉——幻梦池。
With a silent nod, she led the four remaining dispossessed Ionians into the shrine known to her people as the Dael’eh Ahira—the Dreaming Pool.
#### 06
斐洛尔最初的设计并非是一座要塞。和要塞差的十万八千里，这里曾是宁静和启迪的中心，有天赋的艾欧尼亚年轻人会从四面八方前来，学习如何更好地驾驭自己的天生才能。但那个时光早在希里克出生多年以前就已不复再了，这座岛屿曾经活跃着生命、研习与和平，如今则变成了一片不毛之地和一座监狱。几乎没有任何植被生长于要塞周围的岛屿，只有干巴巴的荆棘丛和灰白如幽灵的苔藓能够在这里繁茂。附近岛屿上数目众多的飞鸟和其他野生生命，如今也都绕开这里，除了那些黑暗的充满憎恨的乌鸦和渡鸦，它们跟随诺克萨斯人而来，就再未离开。
Fae’lor was not originally intended as a fortress. Far from it, it was once a center of tranquility and guidance, where gifted young Ionians came, from far and wide, to learn how better to harness their own innate gifts. All that had ended years before Sirik had been born, and the island that had once been teeming with life, study and peace, became little more than a barren prison. Barely any vegetation grew on the island around the fortress now—only dry, brittle thorn-bushes and ghost-gray lichen was able to thrive. Birds and other wildlife, so abundant on the nearby islands, also shunned it now, except for the dark, hateful crows and ravens that had come with the Noxians.

在诺克萨斯入侵以前，希里克和其他守卫在这里担任哨兵，守望着达尔耶·阿希拉。他们的使命是确保那个被关在里面的人永远都不被放出来。
For all of Sirik’s time here, before the invasion, she and other guards had stood sentinel, watching over the Dael’eh Ahira. It was their duty to ensure that the one held within it was never released.

希里克带队走进岩洞的黑暗中，手中举起一颗装满发光翅萤的玻璃球。她打了个冷战，汗毛直立起来，越往下走气温降得越低。
Sirik led the way down into the darkness within the rock, holding aloft a glass sphere filled with glowing flitterwings to light the way. She shivered, skin prickling, as the temperature dropped the deeper they went.

洞穴里的石阶又湿又滑，但她还是箭步向下飞奔，因为要不了多久诺克萨斯追兵就会以压倒性的数量赶上。他们全都做好了有来无回的准备，唯一重要的就是完成此行的目的，将幻梦池里的威胁彻底终结，不留后患。
The stone steps were slick with moisture, but she picked her way down swiftly, for it would not be long before the Noxians arrived in overwhelming force. None of them had expected to make it back from this mission; all that mattered was completing the task they’d come to achieve, and ending the threat imprisoned down here within the Dreaming Pool once and for all.

他们来到了达尔耶·阿希拉的最深处，最后的十尺是崎岖的石块，他们顺势滑下，落在下方的浅水池中激起一片水花。
They reached the deepest point of the Dael’eh Ahira, finally, sliding down the uneven rocks the final ten feet, and landed with a splash in the shallow waters below.

这处神圣所曾是一道美景，但许多年前的灾难让这里成为地下深处的洞穴。
Once, this shrine had been beautiful, but disaster had brought the cavern down in years past.

这里禁锢着的人，就是他们长年守卫的人。
Here was imprisoned the one they had guarded for so many years.

也是现在希里克要杀掉的人。
The one Sirik now came to kill.

卡兰向着石崖顶端大步飞跃，一步十个台阶，很快就将他的手下甩在身后。他独自抵达顶端，面对眼前的景象发出失望的怒吼：四具尸体，两个诺克萨斯人，两个艾欧尼亚人。
Kalan leapt toward the top of the the stone bluff in powerful bounds, clearing ten steps with each one, quickly outpacing his soldiers. He arrived at the peak alone, and growled in frustration as he saw the corpses there: two Noxian, two Ionian.

他没有等待手下，立刻扎进达尔耶·阿希拉。他在黑暗中向下奔跑，他猫科动物的双眼立刻适应了黑暗。他能够尝出空气中人类的味道，顺着这个方向绝没有错。
Without waiting for his warriors, he plunged into the Dael’eh Ahira. Into the darkness he descended, his feline eyes instantly adjusting. He could taste the scent of the humans on the air, leading him on.

卡兰安静地踏入黑暗，他的狩猎开始了。
Padding silently into the gloom, Kalan began the hunt.
#### 07
逐渐昏暗下来的森林美不胜收，不过女孩无心观赏，跺着脚走在蜿蜒曲折的小路上。
The darkening forest was full of beauty, but the girl saw none of it as she stomped along the winding path.

发光的翅萤在暮色中翩翩起舞，身后留下夜光残影，但女孩重重地将它们从面前拍走，毫不在意这转瞬即逝的优雅。她双眼垂向地面，踢开一块石头，任其在盘错的树根间跳跃，毫不理会茂密华盖间透过的夕阳。紫夜貂的花瓣缓缓张开，向温润的暮色吐出微光的花粉，但匆匆路过的她却顺手将花茎扭断。
Glowing flitterwings danced through the twilight, leaving trails of luminescence in their wake, but she swatted them out of her face, oblivious to their fleeting grace. Eyes downcast, she kicked a rock, sending it skidding over the roots twisting across her path, blind to the glorious sunset glimpsed through the canopy. The delicate violet petals of a blooming night-sable unfurled to release its glowing pollen into the warm evening, but she reached out and twisted the flower off its stem as she passed.

她的脸颊由于羞愧和愤怒而烧得通红。母亲的责备依然萦绕在耳边，哥哥和其他孩子的嘲笑始终挥之不去。
Her face burned with shame and anger. The scolding from her mother still lingered, and the laughter of her brother and the others seemed to follow her.

她停下脚步，回头看向小路上残破的花瓣，皱起了眉头。这一切都有些异样……似乎她早已——
She paused, looking back at the broken petals on the path, and frowned. There was something strangely familiar about all of this… almost like she’d—

她的余光中似乎出现了黑色的东西，她环顾四周，想要看清楚。有四个黑影，但只有当她不直视它们的时候才能看得到。
Dark shapes appeared in her peripheral vision, and she looked around, trying to see them clearly. There were four of them, but she could only just make them out if she didn’t look directly at them.

她迷惑地皱起眉头。应该不是这样才对。
Her brow furrowed in confusion. This wasn’t how it was meant to be.

有些地方非常不对劲。
Something was very wrong.
#### 08
希里克和三个同伴站成一圈，俯视着远处的池塘深处。一个女子躺在那里，沉在水面以下，她纯白的长发围绕在身边，慵懒地在水中飘洒。
Sirik and her three companions stood in a circle, looking down into a deeper section of the water. A woman lay there, beneath the surface, her pure white hair, long and flowing, drifting around her languidly.

辛德拉。这既是她的名字，同时也是破坏的代名词，代表着屈服于自己最黑暗的恐惧和愤怒。时至今日这个名字依然在许多省份遭人咒骂。
Syndra. That was her name; a byword for destruction, for giving in to your darkest fears and anger. A name still cursed throughout the provinces.

希里克摘下罩帽露出面孔。她双眼周围精致的靛蓝色刺青似乎在翅萤的摇曳光亮中渐渐扭动。其他人也摘下了头套。所有人脸上都有同样的刺青，这是斐洛尔守护者的象征。所有人都俯视着辛德拉，表情凝重。
Sirik pulled off the dark hood hiding her face and tossed it aside. The delicate, indigo tattoos surrounding her eyes seemed to writhe in the shifting light emitted by the flitterwings in the glass sphere she held aloft. The others removed their head-coverings as well. All of them bore similar tattoos upon their faces, tattoos that marked them as guardians of Fae’lor. All of them looked down at Syndra, their expressions hard.

洞穴的一半已经坍塌，另一半则由一棵古树的庞大根系网勉强支撑，这树根也缠绕着辛德拉的四肢。树根看上去像是慈母在怀抱婴儿，也像是在压制她、束缚她，取决于你的视角。她很容易被误认为已经死了，但是她的胸膛始终都在规律地起伏，呼吸着池中的水。
The roots of an ancient tree—the only thing holding the immense stones from crashing down upon this already half-collapsed cavern—curled around her limbs. They might have been cradling her, like a protective mother, or holding her down, trapping her, depending on your point of view. She could easily have been mistaken for being dead but for the steady rise and fall of her chest as she breathed the water.

辛德拉看上去一点也不凶恶，但希里克非常清楚这种表象多么具有欺骗性。这个人曾摧毁了斐洛尔中心的平静神庙。她能被控制住全都要靠这片土地的灵魂亲自将她拖下来，将她俘获在这奇怪的胶着状态。
Syndra didn’t look at all dangerous, but Sirik knew well how deceiving such an impression was. This one had been responsible for the destruction of the once-peaceful temple at the heart of Fae’lor. She had only been contained when the spirit of the land itself had drawn her down here, pulling her in and ensnaring her within this strange, suspended existence.

希里克曾经提出过自己的疑问，为何要让辛德拉活下来。为何不了结她的性命，彻底免除她从沉睡中苏醒带来的威胁？她的老师父微笑着反问她，如果这片土地想让她死，为何还供养着她？希里克无言以对，当时不懂，现在当然也不懂。她的老师父总是说平衡，但他死了，被诺克萨斯刀剑杀死的，一起死的还有许多人，都曾担任这个沉睡女子的狱卒，但他们所看管的人却还活着。这哪里平衡了？
Sirik had once voiced aloud her confusion as to why they let Syndra live. Why not just end her life, and end the threat of her waking from her slumber? Her old master had smiled, and asked her why, if the land wanted her dead, did it sustain her? Sirik had no answer to that, not then and certainly not now. Her old master talked of balance, but he was dead, killed by a Noxian blade, along with almost all of those who had served here as this slumbering woman’s jailors, yet the one they had guarded still lived. Where was the balance in that?

只要辛德拉活着，她就是威胁，而限制这个威胁的，就是希里克和其他同伴对达尔耶·阿希拉的守望。然而，现如今这里已经被诺克萨斯掌控……这群蠢货很有可能会将她释放，可能是无意之间的疏忽，也可能是自以为是地想要利用她的破坏力量。
As long as she lived, Syndra was a threat, yet that threat was contained while she and the others had stood watch over the Dael’eh Ahira. Now that it was within Noxian control, however… The fools would likely release her, either accidentally or in some ill-advised attempt to utilize her destructive power.

不，这种风险的代价太大了。辛德拉必须死。就今晚。
No, that danger was too great to risk. Syndra must die. Tonight.

希里克将装满翅萤光球扔给她弟弟，然后向池塘深处迈进，刀剑出鞘。
Sirik tossed her flitterwing-filled glow-globe to her brother and stepped into the deeper pool, blade drawn.

“等等，”奥金说。
“Wait,” said Okin.

“没时间了，老弟”希里克说。“诺克萨斯人很快就能追上来。我们必须马上了断。”
“We have no time, brother,” said Sirik. “The Noxians will be upon us momentarily. We must end this now.”

“但她可能是我们反抗的最强武器。”
“But she may be our best weapon against them.”

希里克停住了，慢慢回过头看向她的弟弟，脸上的表情写满了难以置信。
Sirik froze, then turned slowly towards her brother, her expression one of disbelief.

“毕竟，她也是艾欧尼亚人，”奥金继续说道。“她可以成为伟大的盟友。有了她，我们就可以将诺克萨斯赶出艾欧尼亚，一劳永逸！”
“She is Ionian, after all,” continued Okin. “She could be a great ally. With her, we could push Noxus from Ionia, once and for all!”

“然后呢，老弟？你觉得她能被控制住吗？”
“And what then, brother? You think she could be controlled?”

“我们不必控制她！”奥金上前一步，他的声音充满激情。“我们可以进攻诺克萨斯，把战争带到他们的土地上。我们可以——。”
“We wouldn’t need to control her.” Okin stepped forward, his voice full of passion. “We could strike against Noxus, in its heartland! We could—”

“你真傻，老弟，”希里克打断了他，她的语调充满嘲弄。她转过身，开始涉水走向静静躺在不远处的辛德拉。
“You are a fool, brother,” Sirik interrupted him, her voice thick with derision. She turned away, and began to wade towards the motionless figure of Syndra.

“我不能让你乱来，老姐。我们不能让。”
“I can’t let you do that, sister. We can’t let you.”

这时希里克才意识到，她的弟弟和另外两个同伴已经分散开来包围了她，剑拔弩张。“你们不让？”
It was only then Sirik realized her brother and her other two companions had fanned out around her, weapons drawn. “You can’t let me?” she said.

“别逼我们，老姐。”
“Don’t make us do this, sister.”

她的凝视在三人之间跳跃，估算着距离，盘算着自己能否在他们上来之前杀死辛德拉。应该会很接近。
Her gaze flicked between them, judging their distance from her, and whether she would be able to kill Syndra before they reached her. It would be close.

“我不逼你们，”她说。“我们来到这里就是为了终结艾欧尼亚的威胁——而不是将其释放。”
“I’m not making you do anything,” she said. “We came here to end a threat to Ionia—not unleash it.”

“这次机会可以让我们——”
“This could be our chance to—”

“不，”希里克说。“你们还不懂吗？就是这来自艾欧尼亚内部的分裂在害我们，在被诺克萨斯人利用。我们分歧、争吵、内乱，而现在我们最需要的是齐心协力。”
“No,” said Sirik. “Don’t you see? This sort of division within Ionia is killing us, and it’s playing into the Noxians’ hands. We are all divided, arguing and working against each other, when we need to pull together.”

“所以与我们合作吧，”奥金恳求道。
“So work with us,” begged Okin.

希里克指了指静止不动的辛德拉。“她对这片土地的威胁远远大于对诺克萨斯的威胁。只有愚蠢的人才会抱有相反的幻想。”
Sirik pointed at the motionless figure of Syndra. “She is a greater threat to this land than Noxus. It’s a foolish act of desperation to think otherwise.”

“别再这么固执了，一辈子就这一次也好。”
“Just stop being so stubborn, for once in your life!”

“你是说服不了我的，老弟，”她说。“如何。你们要杀了我吗？”
“You’re not going to convince me, brother,” she said. “So what now. You’re going to kill me?”

“求你了，别让事情走到那一步。”
“Please, don’t let it come to that,” said Okin.

四个人站在原地凝滞了一秒钟，他们还都没准备好让形势恶化。
The four of them stood frozen for a second, none quite ready to escalate the situation just yet.

这时一片影子脱离了洞穴原本的黑暗，带着杀意向他们疾驰。
Then a shadow detached itself from the surrounding darkness, and sprang at them with lethal intent.

希里克发出了一声警告，立刻前倾冲刺。她的动作让奥金和其他两人猝不及防，全都举起了武器，防范她的攻击。其中一人甩手飞出一对暗器，他的动作完全处于本能反应。
Sirik gave a shout of warning and lurched forward. The move surprised Okin and their other two companions, who raised weapons, thinking she was attacking. One flung a pair of throwing blades with a sweep of his arm, the move instinctual and reactionary.

希里克躲开了第一把飞刀，但是第二把击中了她，深深刺入她的肩膀，她咬下疼痛，从牙缝中挤出一口气，身体则落入水中。
Sirik swayed aside from the first dagger, but the second struck home, imbedding itself deep in the meat of her shoulder, making her hiss in pain as she stumbled backwards, falling awkwardly in the water.

太晚了，击中希里克的人这才意识到真正的威胁在自己身后。这名艾欧尼亚人被举了起来，胸口穿出一把剑刃，全部剑身彻底穿过他的身体。然后他被扔到一边，黑影般的偷袭者迅速转移，扔掉了剑，下一个目标是奥金。
Too late, Sirik’s attacker realized the real threat was behind him. The Ionian was lifted from his feet, a blade bursting from his chest, having been driven completely through him. Then he was hurled aside, and the shadowy attacker moved on, abandoning his sword and turning on Okin.

袭来的是个瓦斯塔亚，穿着诺克萨斯的盔甲，他咆哮了一声，嘴唇向后翻动，露出了掠食者的尖牙。震耳欲聋的咆哮声在洞穴里回荡。
It was a vastaya, garbed in Noxian armor, and he roared, lips curling back to reveal his predator’s teeth. The sound reverberated painfully within the cavern.

希里克挣扎着站了起来，认出了他。这就是卡兰，普雷西典的无耻叛徒，背弃了自己的人民和艾欧尼亚，向敌人投诚。斐洛尔是赐给他的奖赏，就像是扔给乖巧宠物的骨头。她和她的弟弟有好几个朋友都死在了他手里。
Sirik recognized him, of course, as she struggled to regain her feet. This was Kalan, reviled traitor of the Placidium, who had turned away from his people and Ionia to join the enemy. He’d been given Fae’lor as his prize, a bone thrown to a loyal and subservient pet. She and her brother had lost more than a few friends at his hands.

“诺克萨斯走狗！”奥金说着，伏低了身姿，握好刀剑。“你背叛了我们的人民！你背叛了艾欧尼亚！”
“Noxian lickspittle!” said Okin, crouched low, blade at the ready. “You betrayed our people! You betrayed Ionia!”

卡兰苦涩地笑了一声，静静地走向奥金。他用力张开双手，长长的爪子从指间伸出，前臂的外侧也伸出尖刺。
Kalan gave a bitter laugh as he padded in towards Okin. He flexed his hands, and long talons emerged from his fingertips, as well as along the ridge of his forearms.

“根本不存在艾欧尼亚，”这名瓦斯塔亚战士吼道。“从来都不存在。在初生之土上散落着上千个凡人的文化，每一个都有自己的信仰、习俗、历史和世仇。你们这群人从来都没有过统一，没有过团结。”
“There is no Ionia,” snarled the vastayan warrior. “There never was. A thousand mortal cultures are scattered across the First Lands, each with their own beliefs, customs, history and feuds. Your people have never been unified, never stood as one.”

“或许现在正在改观，”奥金说。“不过你已经站进了败者的队伍。”
“Then perhaps it is time that changed,” said Okin. “Though you have chosen the losing side.”

“败者？这场战争远没有结束，孩子，”卡兰说。
“Losing? The war is far from over, child,” said Kalan.

希里克咧着嘴，拔出了肩膀上的飞刀，鲜血落到了水里，如同一条猩红的丝带在风中飞舞。她轻巧地将飞刀扔到空中，两端翻转，顺势抓住刀刃。她手腕轻弹，将飞刀投向那个叛徒，掩护奥金。
With a grimace, Sirik tore the throwing dagger from her shoulder, her blood leaking out into the water like a crimson ribbon wafting in a breeze. She tossed it deftly into the air, spinning it end over end, and caught it by its blade. With a swift flick of her wrist, she hurled it at the betrayer closing in on Okin.

飞刀深深插入了他脖子的侧面，但希里克还是咒骂自己，因为她稍稍偏离了瞄准的位置，这一击并没有致命。即便如此，奥金和他们最后一个同伴还是抓住了时机，发起冲锋。
It took him in the side of the neck, sinking deep, though Sirik cursed herself, for her aim was slightly off. It was not a killing blow. Nevertheless, Okin and their last companion took advantage of the moment, leaping in to strike.

奥金向前猛冲，但他的攻击被卡兰一掌挡开，紧接着又被一记猛踢击飞到远处。他们最后一个同伴从侧翼快速切入，但这名瓦斯塔亚虽然受了伤，但还是太迅速、太强壮。
Okin dashed forward, lunging, but his strike was turned aside by the flat of Kalan’s hand, who then knocked him away with a sharp kick. Their last companion came in fast from the flank, bladed fans slicing through the air, but the vastaya, even injured, was too fast, and too powerful.

他向侧面一晃，又向反侧一摆，铁扇的锋刃划破了空气。然后他冲向前，双手提起对手的外衣，将她头朝前狠狠撞上石壁。伴着一声恐怖的脆响，她折断了脖子。
He swayed aside, first one way, then the next, as the fan-blades sliced at him. Then, he lunged forward and grabbed his foe by the tunic with both hands, and slammed her head-first into a wall. An awful crack sounded as her neck broke.

卡兰的黄色猫眼再次盯住奥金。
Kalan’s yellow cat eyes turned back to Okin.

希里克的距离太远，她立刻意识到自己帮不上忙了。相反，她回过身开始向着辛德拉费力地行进。她要完成此行的目标。她不指望能活着逃出这次行动，但她坚信自己并不是在白白送命。
Sirik was too far away to help, she knew that instantly. Instead, she turned and began to slog back towards Syndra. She would do what she came to do. She had not expected to escape this venture with her life anyway, but she was determined their deaths would not be in vain.

她听到弟弟的挑战怒吼，还有瓦斯塔亚的咆哮声，但她不敢回头看。她扎进更深的池水中，伸出手向下探，五指扣住了辛德拉的脖子。她的肌肤透着暖暖的体温。希里克的另一只手里，刀刃已经举到致命一击的位置。
She heard her brother shout in defiance, and the vastaya roar, but she dared not look back. She plunged deeper into the water, and reached down, fingers closing around Syndra’s throat. Her skin was warm to the touch. In her other hand, Sirik’s blade drew back for the killing blow.
#### 09
应该不是这样才对。
This wasn’t how it was meant to be.

有些地方非常不对劲。
Something was very wrong.

女孩依然可以听到森林在她身边的夜语。她依然看得见脚下的银蕨和树根，还有华盖之上落日的最后一抹余晖。
The girl could still hear the sounds of the night forest around her. She could still see the ferns and twisted roots, and the last colors of the sunset beyond the thick canopy overhead.

但与此同时，她也听到了吼叫和咆哮声，只不过这些声音好像被什么挡住了，似乎是隔着很远的距离……又似乎是隔着一层水？
But at the same time, she could hear shouts and roars, though they were muffled, as if she was hearing them from a distance… or from underwater?

有那么一瞬间，她觉得喉咙里灌满了液体，心中升起一股恐慌。她溺水了！但不对，不可能。她就在这里，村旁森林暮色中的女孩。她周围没有水。
For a moment, she felt her throat filled with liquid, and a sudden panic rose within her. She was drowning! But no, that was impossible. She was here, a child in the twilight forest outside her village. She was nowhere near water.

她面前出现了一个影子，就像暗夜的恐惧化成的实体。她突然感到喉咙周围被缩紧，然后她开始感到呼吸困难。
A shadowy form appeared before her, like a night-terror given insubstantial form. She felt a sudden constriction around her throat, and she struggled for breath.

她的双眼不停地眨。她看到了一个年轻女子，她的脸上纹满了扭曲的刺青。眼前的景象十分奇怪，还很模糊，似乎是透过水面看到这个人。一只手抓住了她的喉咙，掐住了她的气道，一把刀举在空中，随时可以刺进——
Her eyes flickered. She glimpsed a young woman, her face covered in twisting tattoos. The vision was strange, and vague, however, as if she were looking at this person through water. A hand gripped her throat, choking her, and a blade was raised, ready to plunge down into—

不。
No.

她回到了森林中。她进入了某种恐怖的清醒梦境。她刚跑来这里，羞愧与愤怒染红了她的面颊。她要去灵柳那里，安抚心中激荡的怒火。
She was back in the forest. She was having some kind of awful waking dream. She’d just run here, shame and anger coloring her cheeks. She was going to the ghost-willow, to calm the rage surging within her.

不，她已经经历过一次了。她已经经历过许多次，成百上千次了。一遍又一遍地活在那个时间。
No, she’d already done that. She’d done that over and over, hundreds and thousands of times. Reliving that moment, again and again.

万一这里是梦境，而另一副景象才是现实呢？
What if this was the dream, and the other vision was real?

辛德拉的憎恨和愤怒开始凝聚成黑暗，并在体内激荡。
The darkness of Syndra’s hatred and anger surged within her.

于是她从无尽的梦中醒来。
And she woke from her endless dream.
#### 10
希里克看到辛德拉的双眼猛然睁开。
Sirik saw Syndra’s eyes snap open.

她绝望地大喊一声，手中的刀刃刺了下去，但没有刺到任何东西，因为某种突然出现的无形力量已将她提到空中。她奋力挣扎，狂乱地甩动身体，似乎也是在抵抗涌上来的潮水。她的无力如同猫妈妈口中叼着的猫崽。
With a desperate cry, she stabbed down with her blade, but struck nothing, for she was hauled into the air by some sudden, unseen force. She struggled against it, flailing wildly, but might as well have been trying to fight the rising tide. She was as helpless as a kitten in the mouth of its mother.

辛德拉从树根的捆绑中抽出了手脚，然后钻出水面，大口喘息。池水淅淅沥沥地从她身上淌下来，辛德拉升到了半空中，悬停在水面上方几尺高的地方，下落的水滴在池水脉动的光晕中激起闪烁的光点。辛德拉一只手辐射出黑暗能量，将希里克悬在空中，无可作为，而辛德拉的双眼此刻燃烧着冷酷的火。
Syndra slipped free of the twisting roots that had ensnared her limbs for so many years, and emerged, gasping. Water streamed off her as she rose into the air, hovering several feet above the surface of the pool, shimmering and pulsing beneath her. Dark power radiated from one hand as she kept Sirik held aloft, floating helplessly, and her eyes burned with cold fire.

接下来的景象让希里克既恐惧又痴迷，她看到一顶头盔——或者说是一顶王冠从辛德拉的头上长了出来。头冠环绕她的眉头，如同黑暗被赐予了生命，构成了一对高大、弯曲的犄角。一颗纯粹的暗影之珠出现在头冠正中，像宝石一样剪影，像火一样燃烧，像辛德拉的血一样散发出一波波能量。
As Sirik watched, both horrified and fascinated, a helm—or perhaps a crown—grew into existence upon Syndra’s head. It coiled around her brow, like darkness given life, to form a pair of tall, curving horns. A bead of pure shadow formed at its center, becoming as hard as a gemstone, and burning with the same power that bled from her in waves.

希里克在空中扭来扭去，她的弟弟奥金则挣脱了卡兰的抓握。这时他看到了辛德拉，他的表情充满敬畏。在他看来，那名瓦斯塔亚几乎同样震惊，他猫科的口唇后翻，发出嘶声，瞪圆了双眼。
Sirik twisted in the air as her brother Okin broke from Kalan’s grasp. As he did so, he saw Syndra, his expression one of awe. For his part, the vastaya looked almost as stunned, feline lips curled back in a hiss, his eyes wide.

随着一声恐怖的气流震荡，三个至暗球体在辛德拉身边实体化，然后缓缓围绕她旋转。它们似乎吞没了洞穴中原本就很微弱的光，并且牵拉着希里克的灵魂，一种憎恶和绝望的感觉扼住了她。
With a horrible, sucking sound, three orbs of utter darkness materialised in the air around Syndra, and began to slowly orbit her. They seemed to swallow the scant light in the cavern, and pull at Sirik’s soul, a vile sensation of loathing and despair clutching at her.

“多久了？”辛德拉用命令的口吻问道，她的声音因为长久的沉睡而变得破碎而飘忽。“我被困在这里多久了？”
“How long?” Syndra demanded, her voice cracked and unsteady from lack of use. “How long have I been imprisoned here?”

“几年，”希里克忿忿地吐出几个字。“几十年。我们早就该杀了你。”
“Years,” spat Sirik. “Decades. We should have killed you long ago.”

她感知到了辛德拉的恨，像一把刀一样插进了她体内，她痛苦地喘息。辛德拉愤怒地低吼一声，一挥手把希里克扔到洞穴的角落。
She felt Syndra’s hatred surge as a painful stab within her, and she gasped. Then Syndra snarled in fury, and with a gesture sent Sirik hurtling across the cavern.

她撞上了二十尺开外的岩壁，重重地摔下来，痛苦地倒在地上。随后辛德拉的黑暗凝视转向了奥金和那个诺克萨斯生物。
She smashed against a wall some twenty feet distant, and fell heavily, splashing painfully to the floor. Then Syndra’s dark gaze turned upon Okin and the Noxian creature.

希里克痛得咧嘴。她判断自己摔断了左腿，还有不止一根肋骨，一边退缩一边将自己上半身支撑起来。她惊叫着看到弟弟奥金踉跄地冲进水中，双手抱拳呈恳求状。
Sirik grimaced in pain. Her left leg and more than one rib were broken, she judged, wincing as she struggled to push herself upright. She cried out as she saw her brother Okin stumble forward into the water, holding his hands up in entreaty.

“别，弟弟……”她勉强用微弱的声音说。
“No, brother…” she managed, weakly.

“我不是你的敌人！”奥金大喊道。“我们都是艾欧尼亚的孩子！”
“I am not your enemy!” Okin called out. “We are both children of Ionia! Join us!”

辛德拉俯视着她，目光中辐射出力量。
Syndra looked down upon him, her gaze radiating power.

“诺克萨斯人袭击了我们的土地，屠杀了我们的人民！”他继续说。“我们把他们挡了回去，但他们依然在我们祖先的土地上站住了脚。他们还不肯善罢甘休！艾欧尼亚正在分裂，正面临危难！你必须出手相助！助我们反抗新的暴君！”
“The Noxians attacked our lands, and slaughtered our people!” he continued. “We pushed them back, but they still have a foothold in our ancestral lands. They are not done with us yet! Ionia is divided, and vulnerable! You must help! Help us fight against this new tyranny!”

“我不认识你所说的这些诺克萨斯人，”辛德拉答道。“但如果他们杀了我的人民，那么或许我应该谢谢他们。我所经历的暴政都是应为那些曾被我称呼为同胞的人。”
“I do not know who these Noxians are that you speak of,” Syndra replied. “But if they killed my people, then perhaps I owe them thanks. The only tyranny I experienced was at the hands of those I once called kin.”

奥金的表情充满惊恐，或许他终于意识到自己有多么愚蠢了，他跪坐在原地，彻底放弃。
Okin’s face was mask of horror, perhaps finally realizing his own foolishness, and he slumped to his knees, defeated.

随着一声刺耳的撕裂声，辛德拉又捏制出一枚至暗球体——她全部的憎恨、厌恶和愤怒都倾注其中。它悬浮于辛德拉的掌上，缓缓自转。
With a sickening tearing sound, Syndra conjured another dark sphere—all of her bitterness, resentment and anger made manifest. It hovered above her hand, slowly spinning.

“如果你是艾欧尼亚人，那你就是我的敌人，”她若有所思地说。
“And if you are Ionian, then you are my enemy,” she mused.

希里克尖叫一声，但她无能为力。辛德拉轻弹手腕，手上的黑球立刻向奥金飞去，然后穿透了他。奥金大口喘气，身上渐渐没了血色，最后沉入了水中。
Sirik screamed, but there was nothing she could do. With a flick of her wrist, Syndra sent the orb hurtling toward, then through, her brother. He gasped, all the color draining from his flesh, and sank beneath the waters.

这时卡兰发起了攻击，从黑影中猛冲出来，利爪森森，不过辛德拉又摆了摆手，三颗环绕她的球体向他飞去，将他击退。
Kalan attacked then, leaping from the shadows, claws extended, but another gesture from Syndra sent the three spheres surrounding her hurtling from their orbits towards him, throwing him backward.

“你……”辛德拉一边说，一边把头歪向一侧。“我认识你的灵魂。你的影子遮住了我的梦。”她的表情变得更加黑暗。“你是我的狱卒。你……是你把我关在这里。”
“You…” said Syndra, tilting her head to the side, as if trying to place him. “I recognize your soul. You shadowed my dreams.” Her expression darkened even more. “You were my jailor. You… You kept me here.”

希里克看到那名瓦斯塔亚爬了起来，单膝跪地。
From her position, Sirik saw the vastaya push himself to one knee.

“你是憎恶的化身，”他嘶嘶地说。
“You are an abomination,” he hissed.

辛德拉伸出一只手前插，将那个嘶吼着的生物提到空中。
Syndra’s hand stabbed out, and the snarling creature was lifted into the air.

幻梦池的水翻涌起来，希里克震惊地看到那些曾经束缚着辛德拉的树根动了起来，正在伸向空中，要再次夺走她。
The waters of the Dreaming Pool were churning, and Sirik stared in wonder as the roots that had held Syndra began reaching out to reclaim her.

“那就杀了我吧！”卡兰低吼道。“但动手的同时请别忘了，你永远都不会求得安宁。无论你走到哪里，都将遭到憎恨和追杀。你永远都不能自由地活。”
“Kill me, then!” Kalan snarled. “But do so in the knowledge that you will never find peace. Wherever you are, you will be hated and hunted. You will never live free.”

“杀你？”辛德拉的嘴唇因愤怒而翻卷。“不。那样太便宜你了。”
“Kill you?” said Syndra, her lip curling in rage. “No. That would be too clean an end for you.”

辛德拉手臂一挥，卡兰被扔进了水中，被滚动着的树根死死抓住。有力的根须环住了他的四肢，将他押进水牢。卡兰尖叫者，周围搅起气泡……然后他一动不动地停住了。
With a sweep of her arm, Syndra sent Kalan hurling down into the waters, into the grasp of the writhing roots. They clamped around his limbs reflexively, holding him under. He screamed, air bubbles billowing around him… and then went still.

希里克无畏地盯着辛德拉，她知道自己已经活不长了，但令她意外的是，那位强大的女魔法师根本没理会她。辛德拉只是看向天空的方向。她的双手环绕着黑暗能量，她大喊一声，双手举过头顶。山石碎裂，尘土与石块掉落到池水中，缭乱的波纹从各个方向散布开来。
Sirik stared defiantly at Syndra, knowing that she likely had only moments to live, but to her surprise, the powerful sorceress paid her no mind. Instead, Syndra turned her attention skyward. Both hands were wreathed in dark energy, and with a shout she lifted them high. The stone cracked, and a tumble of dust and rocks fell into the pool, sending crazy ripples spreading out in all directions.

辛德拉用双手作出切割的动作，伴着一声巨响，洞顶被掀开了。大块巨石从她身边落下，重重地砸下来，希里克绝望地向身后爬，每一下动作都让她的腿和侧身灼痛难当。
With a violent cutting motion of her arms and a deafening boom, Syndra ripped apart the rock overhead. Huge chunks of stone fell around her, crashing down with titanic force, and Sirik pushed herself backwards desperately, each movement sending searing pain flaring up her leg and side.

遥远的天空上，星星在眨眼，辛德拉开始上升，向着自由上浮。她最后回头看了一眼脚下，看向沉在水中一动不动的卡兰，树根已将他牢牢捆住。
Stars blinked in the sky far above, and Syndra began to rise, floating up towards freedom. She glanced back down, once, toward the motionless, submerged figure of Kalan, ensnared by roots.

“轮到你做梦了，狱卒，”她轻轻说道，双手一扫，将他埋葬在落石之下。
“Your turn to dream, jailor,” she whispered, and with a sweep of her arms, she entombed him completely beneath the fallen rocks.

希里克每一个动作都伴着扭曲的表情。她努力向远处爬，随时都准备好被巨石碾碎。
Wincing with every movement, Sirik crawled further away, certain she would be crushed at any moment…
#### 11
整座岛屿在隆隆作响，如同遭遇了地震。一场似乎永恒不止的地震。
The island rumbled, as if wracked by an earthquake. It went on for what seemed like an eternity.

当一切停止，令人胆寒的寂静笼罩了整个斐洛尔。
And, when it finally ceased, an unnerving silence fell across Fae’lor.

希里克从昏暗中爬了出来，呼吸到了新鲜空气，环顾四周，目瞪口呆。半个要塞就那么没了。
Sirik crawled from the gloom, breathing in fresh air, and stared about her, eyes wide in shock. Easily half of the fortress was gone.

她向上看去。最开始她只是看到一片没有星星的漆黑。她突然深吸一口气，意识到自己眼前看到的是悬在半空中的高墙和哨塔。它们没有落到海里，而是被连根拔起，飘向天庭。
Her gaze drifted up. At first, she saw nothing but darkness where there should have been stars. With a sharp intake of air, she realized she was looking at the silhouette of the greatest towers and ramparts hanging against the night sky. It hadn’t collapsed into the sea—it had been ripped from the island, and lifted toward the heavens.

她瞪大了眼睛，费力地喘息。她一直都知道辛德拉很强大，但这种程度？这是她从未想象过力量。
She stared, her mouth gaping. She had known Syndra was powerful, but this? This was power she could never have imagined.

眼前的景象让希里克动弹不得，她看到一艘停泊在港口的诺克萨斯战舰被提到了空中。人像蚂蚁一样从上面跌落，落到下方的岩石上摔死。战舰越升越高，然后突然下落，砸在另外两艘船上，全都碎成木渣。破坏的场面犹如天降灾难。
As Sirik watched, frozen by the sight, she saw one of the Noxian warships moored in the harbor below lifted from the sea. Men tumbled from its deck like so many ants, falling to their deaths on the rocks below, as the ship was lifted ever higher. Then it fell, smashing back down upon two other vessels, crushing them to splinters. The destruction was catastrophic.

天空中的城堡废墟开始向北方飘浮。希里克独自一人坐在被削平的达尔耶·阿希拉顶端，目送它离开，直到黎明的第一道曙光爬上地平线。
The ruined castle in the sky began to drift northwards. Alone at the sundered peak of the Dael’eh Ahira, Sirik watched it go, until the first rays of dawn crept over the horizon.

这个夜晚的重量彻底压到她身上。她的弟弟，还有斐洛尔最后的守护者全都死了。除了她自己。
The import of the night weighed upon her heavily. Her brother, and the last of the guardians of Fae’lor were dead. All but her.

换成平时，对诺克萨斯制造如此程度的破坏足以让她拍手称快，但是现在，她心情沉重。
And while the destruction wrought against the Noxians this night would have been cause for great rejoicing at any other time, her heart was heavy.

辛德拉又回到了这个世上。
Syndra was back in the world.

他们失败了。
They had failed.
#### 12
卡兰跪在地上，一动不动、一言不发，他在等待先知开口。她是个奇妙的生物，浑身紫色的皮肤，前额长着一支珍珠光泽的角。有些人可能会误认为她和他是同样的血脉，是瓦斯塔霞瑞的子嗣，但他们的族人非常清楚事实并非如此。
Kalan knelt, motionless and silent, as he waited for the seer to speak. She was a curious creature, violet-skinned, and with a pearlescent single horn growing from her forehead. Some may have mistaken her for one of his bloodline, the children of the Vastayashai’rei, but any of the kin would know otherwise.

这位先知的族类甚至比他们的祖先还要古老。
The seer was of a people older even than his ancestors.

她睁开了眼——那是一双奇异、和蔼、金闪闪的眼睛，看得到远超视力所及的东西。他看到这双眼睛染上了悲伤的颜色，心凉了半截。
When she opened her eyes—those strange, kind, golden-flecked eyes that saw far more than they should—he saw they were tinged with sadness, and his heart sank.

“你面临着两难的抉择，”她的声音如同缓缓落下的秋叶一样安静。
“You are faced with an impossible choice,” she said, her voice as quiet as the rustle of autumn leaves.

“告诉我我该怎么做，”卡兰说。
“Then tell me what I must do,” said Kalan.

“我没法告诉你。你面前有两条路，你只能选择一条。但我警告你——这两条路的尽头都是悲苦和哀伤。”
“That is not for me to say. Two paths lie before you, but you can only take one. I warn you, though—both lead to tragedy and sadness.”

卡兰没有眨眼。“告诉我。”
Kalan didn’t blink. “Tell me.”

“第一条路。你对抗入侵者。在纳沃利的普雷西典，将会有一场大战。虽然代价惨重，但你将得胜。你将被奉为英雄。你和你的灵犀将宁静生活许多年。你很幸福。然而，你将注定活着送走膝下的一对幼仔，他们都死于非命。”
“The first path. You fight the invaders. At the Placidium of Navori, a great battle will be fought. While it will be bloody, you will be victorious. You will be proclaimed a hero. You and your heartlight live in peace for many years. You are happy. And yet, you are destined to outlive both your cubs, who will be taken before their time.”

卡兰深吸了一口气。“另一条路呢？”他说。
Kalan took a deep breath. “And the other?” he said.

“你和敌人并肩作战。你永远都不会再见到你的灵犀，也不会再见到你的幼仔。他们称你为叛徒，咒骂你的名字。这条路充满黑暗、苦涩和骂名。你将被同族憎恨，被入侵者盟友鄙视。他们在普雷西典大败以后，你必须在斐洛尔警备，守护幻梦之地。然后你将留在那里。”
“You fight alongside the enemy. You never see your heartlight again, nor your children. They call you traitor, and curse your name. Your path is one of darkness, and bitterness, and revilement. You will be hated by your kin, and despised by your invader allies. After they are defeated at the Placidium, you must stand vigil on the isle of Fae’lor, guarding over the place of dreaming. And there you will stay.”

“我的小仔呢？”
“And my little ones?”

“他们会活下去。他们会强盛。若不在这片土地，则在另外的地方。但你永远不会再见到他们的面容，而且如果你偏离了这条黑暗之路，他们就将亡命。”
“They live. They prosper. If not in this land, then another. But you will never look upon their faces again, and if you ever deviate from this dark path, they will be lost.”

卡兰点了点头，扶地起身。悲伤企图拖住他，但他将悲伤压了下去，深深埋在心底。
Kalan nodded, and pushed himself to his feet. Sadness threatened to drag him down, but he suppressed it, pushing it deep inside himself.

他环顾四周，仔细看了看先知的小屋，他觉得有种奇怪的熟悉感……隐约觉得似曾相识，似乎这种可怕的悲伤和憾怆已经不止一次地袭来。
As he looked around, taking in the details of the seer’s shrine, he felt that there was something strangely familiar about it… a vague sense that he’d been here before, that he’d felt this awful sense of grief and loss more than once.

他摇了摇头。要被永远困在这个被诅咒的瞬间吗？不得不说，那可是比死亡更糟的命运。
He shook his head. To be trapped in this accursed moment forever? Now, that would be a fate far worse than death.

“对不起，我的孩子，”先知说道。“这个可怕的抉择你必须面对。”
“I am sorry, my child,” said the seer. “It is a terrible choice you must make.”

“不，”卡兰说。“这个抉择很简单。”
“No,” said Kalan. “The choice is a simple one.”
